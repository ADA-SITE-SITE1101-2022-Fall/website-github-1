<h1 id="whoarewe"><br>Website Project</br></h1>
<br></br>

<br></br>
<p>To be honest, we had too much lessons rather than website project. So we planned to start it a few days before deadline, But form the second week our group members started to do the individual part and within 5 days we could finish this part then we started to do the group work part and we could finish it in a day, because we worked together and each of us take a different work, that is why we could fininsh it in a day.  </p>
